1. HATE DSA (VERY INTEGRAL PART OF THE PROBLEM), AS A RESULT:
	1A. CAN'T SIT FOR MORE THAN 5 MIN ON A PROBLEM

2. CAN'T REMEMBER SOME OLD SOLUTIONS.

3. HAVE SOME PROJECTS I WANT TO GIVE MY TIME TO.

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: 	

1. BREAK PROBLEMS INTO SMALLER, FUN CHALLENGES AND SOLVE JUST ONE DAILY.
	1A. USE A TIMER AND START WITH JUST 10-MINUTE PROBLEM-SOLVING SPRINTS.

2. MAINTAIN A DIGITAL NOTEBOOK WITH SOLVED PROBLEMS AND QUICK NOTES FOR REVISION.

3.ALLOCATE FIXED HOURS WEEKLY FOR PROJECT WORK, TREATING IT AS NON-NEGOTIABLE.
